# Energy-Consumption-Forecast

Sally Liu, Charlotte Zhuang

## Abstract

#### What problem our project addresses:

- Due to climate change and modernization, people use more energy than before, which may potentially bring a burden to our environment (as more energy will need to be produced) and see an increase in utility expenses related to energy consumption. Therefore, our project aims to study and predict the pattern of energy consumption, and possibly make some suggestions in energy management and policy-making that will bring benefits to our environment and society.

#### The overall approach we will use to solve the problem:

- Experiment with different machine learning algorithms (linear and nonlinear models) to see which model can achieve the highest accuracy and efficiency in predicting energy consumption.

- Create visualizations to show the hourly trend in energy consumption.

- Detailed analysis and evaluation of the results.


#### How we propose to evaluate our success against our stated goals:

- Determine whether our machine learning model can achieve a certain level of accuracy (above 85%).

- Whether we can derive a couple of valuable suggestions from our results.


## Motivation and Question

- We have a scientific data set for which predictive or exploratory models would help us generate hypotheses and find patterns.

- The result of our project may be used to assist in energy management, reduce utility expenditure, and facilitate energy-related decision and policy making.

# Planned Deliverables

#### Full Success: 

- Successfully create a code repository to showcase the machine learning pipeline to predict electricity demand or price, and have a satisfactory result. If having time, try out both a linear model and a nonlinear model and compare their results, and possibly examine whether additional factors such as weather would affect the prediction.

#### Partial Success:  

- Successfully create a code repository to showcase the machine learning pipeline to predict electricity demand or price, yet the result may not be as accurate as expected.


## Resources Required

- Dataset from kaggle.com:

“Hourly Energy Demand Generation and Weather”

## What You Will Learn

- How to work as a team efficiently and support each other.

- Project management skills: how to manage time, adjust work accordingly, solve problems.

- Learn version control.

- Try to apply knowledge learned in class and implement machine learning models to solve real-world problems.

## Risk Statement

- The features we select may not be the “best” ones for predictions.

- The model we choose may not be effective in prediction.

- There might not be very clear and explainable patterns based on our dataset.

## Ethics Statement

#### 1. What groups of people have the potential to benefit from our project?

- People who seek to reduce their energy consumption or expenditure on energy.

- Government or social organizations related to energy.

- Environmental activists.

#### 2. What groups of people have the potential to be excluded from benefit or even harmed from our project?

- If companies try to earn more revenues by raising unit electricity price according to the energy consumption prediction, then households will be harmed.

- The prediction might not be applicable to people in some other regions (e.g. prediction based on data from developed countries may not be applicable to undeveloped ones; predictions based on urban areas may not be applicable to rural areas.)

#### 3. Will the world become an overall better place because we made our project?

- Yes! Because our project could potentially help government to make better environmental policies or arrangements that can possibly reduce energy consumption:

(1) Our world will become more sustainable if energy-saving strategies can be improved based on our prediction.

(2) Households will be able to save more money if they adjust their energy consumption according to our prediction.
